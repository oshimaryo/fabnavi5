=== kgio 2.9.3 - minor cleanups and fixes / 2015-01-12 08:46 UTC

  Most notably there's a new RB_GC_GUARD to fix an occasional segfault at
  load time for Ruby 1.8 users thanks to Petr Novodvorskiy for reporting
  the issue.

  There's been a new mailing list for a few months now at:

      kgio-public@bogomips.org

  There's also a bunch of code cleanups and packaging
  cleanups.  Our website is faster now thanks to olddoc:
